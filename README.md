# Calculator
A Windows 10 Calculator like clone build in Java Swing

My First project. I tried figure out complex interaction during calculation and between methods. I also wanted to implement my first APIs.
This calculator is a versatile unit of measurement converter as well and it includes a (crypto) currency converter 
that gets an up to date list of exchange rates from the implemented APIs.
